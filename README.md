# What [API Foundation](https://www.apifoundation.com) is?

![logo](https://logo.apifoundation.com/2/cover.png)

API Foundation provides solutions for building applications and services in any environment.
The Foundation API based on shell scripts that allow you to retrieve, manage and publish Your data to various display services, run geoprocessing models, and more.
Our workflow in SOftware Development is clear:

    Standardisation -> Modularisation -> Automation

it's a Continuous Improvement, never end development.

## Why API Foundation?

API Foundation Service has been developed as a best practice to integration capability of software, to give end customers the best product and service!

+ What are You doing for Yours environment?


### Alternative way

May be You are using in Your organisation many different solution, may be one cloud based.

How old are these technologies, what can be after 10 years?

If You are creating serious software for long term, the perspective is very important.

That's why API Foundation is not creating new tool, just using the old school tools in beauty way, because  
the quality is for us very important and we expect long-term solution, which is not just popular solution for today!

If You are looking for long term solutions the standards are clear, what you can just make better are standards of usage it, such testing

For us is clear that we need solution for whole our (not just application) life.  
It can take next 50 years for support API Foundation solutions.

We know it and we are ready for it!

+ How will change the technology?
+ How will change the people and world?


Nobody knows, so the best what we can do now is to prepare the ecosystem with understandable and tested solutions for decades.

The roles are clear:

#### Simplicity

+ [KISS-Prinzip – Keep it simple *](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS-Prinzip)

+ Keep it simple, stupid
+ Keep it simple and short
+ Keep it simple and smart
+ Keep it simple and straightforward

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson.[3] The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.[4] Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward",[5] "keep it small and simple", or "keep it stupid simple".[6]



#### Transparent (for everyone)

+ Create readable & testable code of your environment through standards
+ The term transparent is widely used in computing marketing in substitution of the term invisible, since the term invisible has a bad connotation (usually seen as something that the user can't see and has no control over) while the term transparent has a good connotation (usually associated with not hiding anything)

#### Opened (for The Future)

+ Use opened solutions, which are free and opensource for long term with support & community
+ Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community.
+ Free and open-source software (FOSS) or Free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS) is openly shared source code that is licensed without any restrictions on usage, modification, or distribution.[citation needed] Confusion persists about this completely unrestricted definition because the "Free", also known as "Libre", refers to the freedom or the product not the price, expense, cost, or charge.

## Benefits

+ low entry threshold for learning / understanding these standards
+ such many opensource projects, we share open ideas with wide spectrum of usage
+ our goals are on technical sides, the rule is: better high technical level than high level of monetizing
+ that the reason, why we don't care about fast earaning money, but fast creating usage solutions on wide spectrum.

## What we offer You?

We Love Software Development and we create the best solutions with pleasure!
We are able to create the best solutions, because we have deep understanding of technology based on advanced projects.
We are earning money on trainings for teams which are opened to increase quality of software development at any time.
We are independent and free to create the best IT solutions on the World!

+ [EDUCATION.md](EDUCATION.md)

### Example of wide spectrum on technical side

if You need solve technical problem based on Python/Java/NodeJS, many solutions are based on one language.
In APIFoundation case we are supporting and providing for each language the same SDK solution, which avaliable to use in your application programming language.

Who give you the opportunity to use your own technical solutions in external libraries?
We're opened and we're giving You opensource code which is ready to set and go!

## How we understand an API

An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow

API (od ang. application programming interface)

Today, with the rise of REST and web services over HTTP, the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the Web APIs section).

The term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.

# Softreck's API Foundation

The API Foundation is created and sponsored by the Softreck from Estonia.
Softreck Company is sharing tools to give Organisations more benefits, to have under control all steps in software and Hardware Development.
+ [Leadership Through Software Development](https://softreck.com)


## Leadership through software development
At Softreck, we strive to go beyond securing smart technical resources by aiming to become your strategic advisors, providing both thought leadership and best practice to ensure that you are confident in being able to deliver solid results in less time and increase your ROI (Return on Investment).

## Team
That is why our specialised team is built with the right mix of highly skilled architects and consultants, supported by management with years of industry experience.

## Capabilities and requirements of application
The selection and deployment of an initial production API capability is used to prioritise and showcase the baseline platform, whilst delivering a tangible benefit to the business through better alignment and communication of capabilities and requirements.

## Monitoring and report
Another key deliverable is a detailed report and executive presentation that provides Softreck’s assessment for the customer’s desired connectivity/integration platform maturity.

## Our Help

We use technology such as Open API and Deep-Link connections, we can integrate that service into your business platform.

Whether it’s through embedded technology or something as simple as a booking widget, your clients can now access our booking system directly.
We’ll even offer you a return on any reservations made.

Turning a clever feature into a profitable solution.
