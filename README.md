# What [**MODWARE**](https://docs.modware.org) is?


![logo](https://logo.modware.org/2/cover.png)

**MODWARE** provides solutions for building applications and services in any environment.
The Foundation API based on shell scripts that allow you to retrieve, manage and publish Your data to various display services, run geoprocessing models, and more.
Our workflow in SOftware Development is clear:

    Modularisation -> Standardisation -> Automation

it's a Continuous Improvement, never end development.




## Why **MODWARE**?

**MODWARE** Service has been developed as a best practice to integration capability of software, to give end customers the best product and service!

+ What are You doing for Yours environment?

Bring your creative vision to life with MODWARE tools.



### Alternative way

May be You are using in Your organisation many different solution, may be one cloud based.

How old are these technologies, what can be after 10 years?

If You are creating serious software for long term, the perspective is very important.

That's why **MODWARE** is not creating new tool, just using the old school tools in beauty way, because  
the quality is for us very important and we expect long-term solution, which is not just popular solution for today!

If You are looking for long term solutions the standards are clear, what you can just make better are standards of usage it, such testing

For us is clear that we need solution for whole our (not just application) life.  
It can take next 50 years for support **MODWARE** solutions.

We know it and we are ready for it!

+ How will change the technology?
+ How will change the people and world?


Nobody knows, so the best what we can do now is to prepare the ecosystem with understandable and tested solutions for decades.

The roles are clear:

#### Simplicity

+ [KISS-Prinzip – Keep it simple *](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS-Prinzip)

+ Keep it simple, stupid
+ Keep it simple and short
+ Keep it simple and smart
+ Keep it simple and straightforward

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated;  
therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.  
The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson.  
The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.  
Variations on the phrase include:  
 "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward", "keep it small and simple", or "keep it stupid simple".



#### Transparent (for everyone)

+ Create readable & testable code of your environment through standards
+ The term transparent is widely used in computing marketing in substitution of the term invisible, since the term invisible has a bad connotation (usually seen as something that the user can't see and has no control over) while the term transparent has a good connotation (usually associated with not hiding anything)

#### Opened (for The Future)

+ Use opened solutions, which are free and opensource for long term with support & community
+ Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community.
+ Free and open-source software (FOSS) or Free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS) is openly shared source code that is
licensed without any restrictions on usage, modification, or distribution.
Confusion persists about this completely unrestricted definition because the "Free", also known as "Libre",
refers to the freedom or the product not the price, expense, cost, or charge.

## Benefits

+ low entry threshold for learning / understanding these standards
+ such many opensource projects, we share open ideas with wide spectrum of usage
+ our goals are on technical sides, the rule is: better high technical level than high level of monetizing
+ that the reason, why we don't care about fast earaning money, but fast creating usage solutions on wide spectrum.


### native interface, code, environment
![api-foundation-plants.png](docs/api-foundation-plants.png)

Why do we think our solution is the best?
Because we never create plastic entities, pseudo-languages.
We base projects with standard standards, MODWARE provides them in a modularized form.


## What we offer You?

We Love Software Development and we create the best solutions with pleasure!
We are able to create the best solutions, because we have deep understanding of technology based on advanced projects.
We are earning money on trainings for teams which are opened to increase quality of software development at any time.
We are independent and free to create the best IT solutions on the World!

+ [EDUCATION.md](EDUCATION.md)

### Example of wide spectrum on technical side

if You need solve technical problem based on Python/Java/NodeJS, many solutions are based on one language.
In MODWARE case we are supporting and providing for each language the same SDK solution, which  
avaliable to use in your application programming language.

Who give you the opportunity to use your own technical solutions in external libraries?
We're opened and we're giving You opensource code which is ready to set and go!

## How we understand an API

An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow

API (od ang. application programming interface)

Today, with the rise of REST and web services over HTTP, the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the Web APIs section).

The term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.

## modular foundation

Let's explore its key aspects: **Design**, **Standards**, **Principles**, and the foundational elements that support it:

### Design for Modular Construction
Modular construction involves prefabricating building components off-site and then assembling them at the project location. It integrates design, manufacturing, and construction processes while maintaining aesthetic intent.
The **American Institute of Architects (AIA)** provides a comprehensive guide titled "Design for Modular Construction: An Introduction for Architects." This guide explains the benefits, challenges, and best practices of modular design and construction¹. You can download the PDF to learn how to apply modular techniques to your projects.

### Standards for Efficient Modular Construction
Standards play a crucial role in ensuring effective, efficient, and resilient modular construction. They provide guidance, best practices, and requirements.


### Modular Principles
Modular design principles guide the creation of modular systems. Key principles include separation, unification, connection, and adaptation.
   

### Modular Foundation
The modular foundation encompasses all the above aspects—design, standards, and principles. It forms the essential groundwork for successful modular projects.
While specific sources directly addressing "modular foundation" may be limited, understanding the interplay of design, standards, and principles is crucial for building a robust modular framework:  [www.moduletool.com](https://www.moduletool.com/)

Modularyzacja jest ważnym aspektem w dzisiejszym świecie technologii i może przynieść wiele korzyści w projektowaniu i utrzymaniu systemów.

1. **Modular Design (Projektowanie Modułowe)
   - **Modularny design** to podejście projektowe, które skupia się na tworzeniu systemów lub produktów za pomocą **modułów**. Każdy moduł jest samodzielny i może być łatwo wymieniany lub modyfikowany bez wpływu na inne części systemu.
   - Przykład: Projektowanie samochodu z oddzielnymi modułami dla silnika, układu elektrycznego, wnętrza, itp.

2. **Modular Standards
   - **Modularne standardy** to zbiór zasad i wytycznych, które mają na celu zapewnienie spójności i interoperacyjności między różnymi modułami w systemie.
   - Przykład: Standardy komunikacji między różnymi komponentami oprogramowania w architekturze mikroserwisów.

3. **Modular Principles
   - **Modularne zasady** to fundamentalne przekonania i wytyczne, które kierują projektowaniem i implementacją modułów.
   - Przykład: Zasada "jednej odpowiedzialności" mówiąca, że każdy moduł powinien mieć jedno konkretne zadanie.

4. **Modular Foundation
   - **Modularna podstawa** to kompleksowe podejście, które łączy wszystkie aspekty modułowego świata: design, standardy i zasady.
   - Przykład: Organizacja Modware pracuje nad tworzeniem fundamentów, które wspierają rozwój modułowych systemów.

## API approach
The Benefits of an API-First Approach
An API-first approach to building products can benefit your organization in many ways. 
And API first approach requires that teams plan, organize, and share a vision of their API program. 
In **MODWARE** we build and share many tools that support an API first approach.

## start API

Web APIs have been around for nearly 20 years.
Form past few years are using defined concept of "API first" has gained traction with software teams. 

## Current
The number of developers taking an API-first approach to building products is rising. So today we thought we would introduce you to the concept of API first and why this approach is growing in prominence.

## What Does an API-First Approach Mean?

That everything about a project revolves around the idea that the end product will be consumed by mobile devices
and that APIs will be consumed by client applications.

## language
An API-first approach involves developing APIs that are consistent and reusable, which can be accomplished by using an API description language to establish a contract for how the API is supposed to behave. 

## contract
Establishing a contract involves spending more time thinking about the design of an API. It also often involves additional planning and collaboration with the stakeholders providing feedback on the design of an API before any code is written.
The Growing Popularity of API-First

## data consumption
Today, both humans and machines are consuming data. Humans consume data through applications, often from many different devices  — smartphones, laptops, tablets, and desktops. Many different types of devices mean many different screen sizes. Organizations must build apps that look good and work well across all devices. 

## strategy
An API-first strategy allows organizations to build APIs that serve all applications and applications can be developed and maintained efficiently for all devices, platforms, and operating systems.

## Benefits


### Development teams can work in parallel with many apps, backend, frontend, devops

## contract first
API first involves establishing a contract.
Creating a contract between services that is followed by teams across an organization allows those teams to work on multiple APIs at the same time. Developers do not have to wait for updates to an API to be released before moving on to the next API. 
Teams can mock APIs and test API dependencies based on the established API definition.
Reduces the cost of developing apps.

### modularisation
APIs and code can be reused on many different projects. When a development team wants to build a new app, they don’t have to start from scratch which is time-consuming and costly. API-first design also allows most problems to be solved before any code is even written which helps prevent problems when it is time to integrate APIs with applications.
Increases the speed to market

### Automatisation
Much of the process of building APIs can be automated using tools that allow import of API definition files. 
Our tools allow import of API definition files, and with those files API tools such as API documentation, SDKs, and mock APIs can be auto-generated. Automation significantly speeds up the development of APIs and applications.   

### benefits such on flat architecture
API first also makes it possible to add new services and technologies to applications without having to re-architect the entire system. The competition is fierce when it comes to developing applications, so apps must be developed quickly. 

### Ensures good developer experiences

Consumers of APIs are most often developers, and developer experience (DX) can make or break the success of an API.
API first ensures that developers have positive experiences using your APIs. 

### learning curve

Well-designed, well-documented, consistent APIs provide positive developer experiences because it’s easier to reuse code and onboard developers, and it reduces the learning curve. 
Reduces the risk of failure

For most companies, APIs are used in nearly every business process — from marketing and sales to communication and consumer-facing applications, which means that APIs can impact every part of your business positively or negatively. API first reduces the risk of failure by ensuring that APIs are reliable, consistent, and easy for developers to use.


## How to start?

### Brainstorm 
First, it is necessary to identify key services your business offers and capabilities of the business. 
+ figure out the kinds of APIs that should be built and which services should be offered via APIs
+ figure out and write down the use cases for each API
+ write down potential endpoints based on those use cases
    
### Establish API stakeholders
Who are the stakeholders within your organization? As many people as possible should be involved in your API initiative – you need company-wide buy-in and a vision that is shared by teams within your organization. Also, allow stakeholders to weigh in on the design of the API. Stakeholders can then agree on interactions across the organization so that APIs remain consistent.
    
### Design an API contract, Consistency is key
+ The contract establishes a set of standards and best practices for designing APIs
+ Be sure to describe and document all APIs. 
+ Ensure that all APIs work the same, from endpoint names and URLs to error codes and versioning. 


### Create a style guide
+ A comprehensive, cohesive style guide ensures consistency across the teams of an organization who are building services. 
+ API status codes, versioning, error handling, and more will be standardized ensuring that APIs are designed the same way. 
+ Use a tool to create a style guide for all APIs across your organization.
    
### Implement API governance
+ An API governance process can help enforce established standards and reinforce desired outcomes. 
+ We discuss API governance in an upcoming blog article. 
+ Conducting peer code reviews can also help ensure that API design standards are followed and that developers are producing quality code.
    
### Automate processes 
+ Use tools to automate processes like generating API documentation, style validation, API mocking, and versioning. 
+ Also, make APIs self-service so that developers can get started building apps with your APIs right away. 
+ Provide interactive documentation or a sandbox so that developers can try out API endpoints. 
    
### Track and manage your API portfolio
+ Avoid duplicating code and building redundant APIs by tracking and managing your API portfolio.
+ Implement a system that helps you track and manage your APIs. 
+ The larger your organization and platform becomes, the harder it gets to track APIs and their dependencies.

### Create a portal for internal developers
+ Create a central place for internal developers a place where everything for all your APIs is stored:
+ API specification
+ documentation
+ contracts
